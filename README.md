SnapIt
======

A photo-blogging app I made to share pictures of my study abroad trip

The SnapIt photo blogger allows users to create an account and upload all of their photos onto it. Users can also create and manage albums, add their own photo captions, and view other SnapIt user's photos. 

**NOTE: To run this application yourself, you must put in your own MySQL database information in many of the PHP files
